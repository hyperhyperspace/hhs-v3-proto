# Prototype for v3 of Hyper Hyper Space

This prototype explores two core ideas for the next version of the Hyper Hyper Space BFT sync engine.

Commands:
```
yarn build
yarn test
```
Two main ideas were explored in this prototype: state materialization via Merkle Search Trees, and a new conflict-resultion mechanism.

The new conflict resolution scheme seems very promising.

Conclusions and recommendations for v3 can be found here:
